# cs50_pong

Pong made with LÖVE for the CS50 Videogames Track.
Every folder is a step in the making of the game, being pong12 the playable version.
For now it only has one mode: player vs player (one moves with W / S and the other with UP / DOWN).
In the future I'll add a menu and a mode against an AI.

PS: to open the game you need to install LÖVE and then drag the pong folder to the LÖVE executable.
